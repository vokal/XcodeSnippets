iOS_SharedSnippets
==================

This is a repository for code snippets that members of the iOS team have found useful.  The easiest way to integrate this into xcode is to use the [ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin](https://github.com/acoomans/ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin) that can be installed via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/).  Follow [these **Configure**](https://github.com/acoomans/ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin#configuration) instructions using your own fork of this repository instead of creating a new one.

If you have any other Snippets that you would like to share make a PR!
